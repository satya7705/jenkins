Set Git to always rebase when pulling:
git config --global pull.rebase true

Then you can just do:
git pull
git push

and it keeps your branch in sync automatically.

If you want, I can give you a single-line workflow that does pull → commit → push safely every time to avoid this error.
Do you want me to do that?
